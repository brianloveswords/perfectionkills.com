<p><a href="http://mediumexposure.com">Max</a> and I have just updated <a href="http://scripteka.com">Scripteka</a> to version 1.1</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t been following things around here, Scripteka is the prototype extensions library &#8211; a convenient place to find, rate and submit prototype.js based goodness.<br/><br />
The library still looks and feels the same, since our main goal was to improve overall usability and functionality.</p>

<p>Some of the new features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User Dashboard, where one can see all their scripts, and edit them.</li>
  <li>Image upload for scripts. Finally, you can replace that default &#8220;empty page&#8221; image with your own.</li>
  <li>Improved RSS feed with more useful information, and better formatting.</li>
  <li>Improved communication and response to various actions. This includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Automated, token-based &#8220;claim script&#8221; feature.  No more claiming script and not knowing what to do next.</li>
    <li>More robust and informative feedback on script approval/rejection.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Small usability improvements.</li>
  <li>Many bug fixes, polishing.</li>
</ul>
