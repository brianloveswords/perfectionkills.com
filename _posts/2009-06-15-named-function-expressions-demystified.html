<h2>Named function expressions demystified</h2>

<p>After a couple of months, I have finally finished <a href="http://kangax.github.io/nfe" title="">an article on named function expressions</a>. It&#8217;s meant to demystify some of the common misconceptions I&#8217;ve seen on the web, take an in-depth look at cross-browser quirks and explain how to safely &#8220;work around&#8221; them. Quite obviously, it also explains what named function expressions are good for and how to &#8220;take advantage&#8221; of them in your applications.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or find any mistakes, please let me know. Hope you like it.</p>
