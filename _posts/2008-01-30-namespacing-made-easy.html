<h2>Namespacing made easy</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable/inject" title="Enumerable#inject documentation">Enumerable#inject</a> is one scary method. It took me a while to understand the beauty of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_%28higher-order_function%29" title="Fold (higher-order function)">functional programming paradigm</a>.  Just in case you were ever wondering about its real life usage &#8211; here&#8217;s one of them.</p>

<p>We all know that using namespaces is generally a wise thing to do. You don&#8217;t have to create a multi level object structure, but nesting your code under a pseudo-namespace is what makes maintenance, upgrades and migrations somewhat easier and error-prone.</p>

<p>Few popular javascript libraries implement some sort of a utility function that automatically creates nested objects. What it means is that instead of writing it manually, you could let the helper handle it for you:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>
// creating nested structure manually is painful
var com = {
  thinkweb2: {
    projects: {
      _prototype: 'a deeply nested property...'
    }
  }
};

com.thinkweb2.projects._prototype // => 'a deeply nested property...'
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it appears that inject can handle such task in only <strong>3 lines of code</strong>:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>
'com.thinkweb2.projects.prototype'.split('.').inject(window, function(parent, child) {
  var o = parent[child] = { }; return o;
});

Object.inspect(com.thinkweb2.projects.prototype); // => "[object Object]"
</code></pre>

<p>Not bad &#8211; a completely generic namespacing snippet.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s happening here is not a black magic. Inject accepts initial object as a first argument (in this case &#8211; window object) and iterator function as the second argument. It then calls iterator function on each item from the collection (in our case it&#8217;s simply a string split into an array). Iterator function receives <strong>accumulated result</strong> as a first argument and current value as a second. Iterator performs an action (creates a nested object) and returns accumulated result (the newly created parent object) to be used in following iterations.  </p>

<p>Alternatively, we could wrap this all nicely and define as a String.prototype method:</p>

<pre lang="javascript"><code>
String.prototype.namespace = function(separator) {
  this.split(separator || '.').inject(window, function(parent, child) {
    var o = parent[child] = { }; return o;
  });
};

foo.bar.baz.quux = 'Nothing special...'; // => ERROR: foo is not defined

// Default separator is '.'
'foo.bar.baz.quux'.namespace();

foo.bar.baz.quux = 'Nothing special...'; // => "Nothing special..."

// Or using a custom one
'MY_AWESOME_APPLICATION::util::DOM::dimensions'.namespace('::');

'dimensions' in MY_AWESOME_APPLICATION.util.DOM; // => true
</code></pre>

<p>Note how we use &#8220;separator&#8221; argument (or defaulting to &#8216;.&#8217;) making the function somewhat more flexible.</p>

<p>P.S.<br />
Heavy namespacing could lead to unnecessary complexity.<br />
Lack of it &#8211; to buggy behavior.<br />
In the end, the only thing that matters is what works best for you.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
