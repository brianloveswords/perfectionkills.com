<h2>Prototype 1.6.0.2 Cheat Sheet</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 40px">A long awaited <strong>Prototype cheat sheet</strong>  &#8211; a full reference to a <strong>bleeding edge 1.6.0.2</strong> is finally <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/downloads/Prototype Cheat Sheet 1.6.0.2" title="prototype (v1.6.0.2) cheat sheet ">here</a>. I had no experience creating something like this before, so any bugs or suggestions are very much appreciated.  Couple of notes about notations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modules are sorted in a somewhat logical order &#8211; those commonly used are mostly in the left/center area, while deprecated/utility methods are all the way to the right</li>
  <li>Method can be recognized by parentheses following it (anything that doesn&#8217;t have ones is a property)</li>
  <li>Deprecated items are marked red and have NO parentheses/arguments specified</li>
  <li>Prototype extends quite few native objects&#8217; prototypes with a set of convenient methods. In such cases there&#8217;s an explicit note about it next to a module name &#8211; i.g. <code>stripScripts()</code> method from &#8220;String (String.prototype)&#8221; can be called as <code>'foo'.stripScripts()</code></li>
  <li>When a module is also a class, there&#8217;s a &#8220;(constructor)&#8221; note next to it &#8211;  i.g. &#8220;Hash (constructor)&#8221; means that it should be called as <code>new Hash()</code></li>
  <li>There are few bonus items (such as those from Prototype.Browser) which are not yet included in documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://perfectionkills.com/downloads/Prototype Cheat Sheet 1.6.0.2" title="prototype (v1.6.0.2) cheat sheet ">Download</a> (<span style="color: #ff5555">55534</span> downloads) and Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
I have managed to choose the most retarded format for the cheat sheet &#8211; almost squared &#8211; which was impossible to print or navigate. Sincere apologies.  There is an updated version at the same address which also fixes few other annoyances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ajax.Responders is now a separate section</li>
  <li>Added missing Event.fire</li>
  <li>Added Prototype.BrowserFeatures.XPath</li>
  <li>Added simple &#8220;Dimensions/Offsets&#8221; diagram</li>
  <li>Minor rearrangements</li>
</ul>
  <p><strong>Update 2:</strong><br />
Uploaded a <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/downloads/Prototype Cheat Sheet 1.6.0.2 b/w">Higher Contrast version</a> (<span style="color: #ff5555">8344</span> downloads)<br />
Seems to look much better when printed.</p>
