<h2>So you want more documentation?</h2>

<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">prototype</a>? I&#8217;m sure you have, since you&#8217;re reading this blog. Many things make this library a <strong>weapon of choice</strong> for developers all over the world. The way work is done with prototype is simply mind blowing &#8211; concise and expressive code, full range of tools for the job just seem to make a dream come true. One day, though, you run into problems &#8211; things just don&#8217;t work the way they&#8217;re supposed to. You open your browser, point it to google and&#8230; dark side of prototype reveals itself in its full glory&#8230; </p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m not trying to sound dramatic, but the fact is that prototype is notoriously famous for the lack of down-to-earth documentation. For javascript ninjas, quick glance over source code should clear all the confusion. For the rest of us, there&#8217;s a wonderful place called <a href="http://prototypejs.org/api">API reference</a>. This should be your first bookmark on the way to perfection. The sad part is that not everyone understands API reference. People demand easy to follow tutorials, out-of-the-box solutions and lower taxes.</p>

<p>For all of you &#8211; lazy bastards &#8211; out there, here&#8217;s a list of must know resources:</p>

<h3>Official documentation</h3>

<p><a href="http://prototypejs.org/api">Prototype API reference</a><br />

<a href="http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/">Script.aculo.us wiki</a></p>

<h3>News groups:</h3>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-spinoffs">Google groups, RoR Spinoffs</a> &#8211; Number 1 place to look for answers, ask questions, get help quickly. Some really smart folks help hundreds of people with most twisted problems (yes, you&#8217;re right, 90% are IE related)</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/prototype-core/">Google groups, Prototype: Core</a> &#8211; Once you know prototype&#8217;s source code by heart, feel free to join this group to discuss the inner essence of prototype&#8217;s magic. Other than that &#8211; great place to search for issues that might have already been solved before.</p>

<h3>Core developers&#8217; blogs</h3>
