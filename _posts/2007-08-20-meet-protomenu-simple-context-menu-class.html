<h2>Meet Proto.Menu – simple context menu class</h2>

<p>Context menus are a great way to enhance user experience when used appropriately. About a half year ago, I needed one. There were few decent solutions out there but none of them was what I needed. YUI menu seemed like a solid solution but was just too much, as I only needed basic set of features. After spending couple of days figuring out all the right-click browser quirks <a href="http://kangax.github.io/proto.menu" title="Proto.Menu">Proto.Menu</a> was born &#8211; a simple class on top of prototype.</p>

<p>Few days ago, playing with new release of prototype, I realized how much this little context menu script would benefit from new DOM builder and other 1.6 goodies. The class was almost completely rewritten and while at the same ~2KB, it now has a set of useful options and is more cross-browser than ever : )</p>

<p>In case anybody was looking for something like that, you might want to <a href="http://kangax.github.io/proto.menu" title="Proto.Menu">give it a try</a>.</p>
